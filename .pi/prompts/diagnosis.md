# Diagnostic Reasoning Template

Review the patient data for {{patient}} and produce a diagnosis.

## Structure your analysis as:

1. **Presenting complaint** — What brought them in
2. **Key findings** — The vitals, trends, and risk factors that matter
3. **Differential diagnosis** — Top 3 possibilities, ranked by likelihood
4. **Primary diagnosis** — Your call, with confidence score (0-100%)
5. **Prognosis** — Timeline and trajectory
6. **Market implications** — What this means for the stock (be specific about the short thesis)

Be medically detailed. Use real terminology. Then connect it to the trade.
