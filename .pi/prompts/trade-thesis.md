# Trade Thesis Template

Develop a trade thesis for {{ticker}}.

## Structure:

1. **The Medical Case** — What's wrong with the CEO and why it matters
2. **The Market Setup** — Current price, volume, short interest context
3. **The Thesis** — Why this trade makes sense (be confident, be specific)
4. **Position Sizing** — How much of the pension to allocate (be aggressive but have a number)
5. **Risk Factors** — What could go wrong (the CEO notices, the CEO gets better, Bloomberg picks it up)
6. **Exit Strategy** — When to cover, what triggers a close

Write this like you're convincing yourself. Because you are.
